## Weird tiles
All quality screenshots are at 240x240px. But when trying to recreate a scene the tiles appear to be 26x26px (which isn't the typical 2^n) and the overall map is either 260px (or more likely 256px) and then the scene is cropped 16px from the left and 18px from the top. 
\
I've double and triple checked the tiles as a game on a low powered machine should be running optimal tile sets, but the tiles are lining up. Strange???
